# Assignment

This project contains a programme namely 'Process.java' that reads an input file and counts number of occurances of a given list of keywords.
In order to test this, I have added some Junit tests like, ProcessTest.java, ProcessTest1.java, ProcessTest2.java, ProcessTest3.java. The corresponding
test data files are available under /bin/practice/testdata/. 

In the process 'ProcessTest*.java'', replace the file path and then run the test. For example, in the ProcessTest2.java, replace at the line
Process proc=new Process("/<replace file path>/Test2.txt");

Note that ProcessTest.java does not need an input file in order to test the condition when no input file is provided.
